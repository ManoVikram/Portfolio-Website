Experimenting with what you have learnt is more fun and powerful than just learning. I find it fun to try out new technologies and get a taste of it. I primarily work with Flutter to build awesome UI, PostgreSQL for backend database and GoLang for building RESTful APIs. Creating content on YouTube is something I do as a hobby.",
